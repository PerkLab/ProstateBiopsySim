# ProstateBiopsySim
TRUS and prostate biopsy training simulator

## Background
Helping to create sustainable medical programs for African healthcare centres. There is a current need in Senegal for training and clinical applications of ultrasound (US) guided interventions, specifically prostate cancer imaging tools. This program will be designed to train medical workers in the prostate biopsy procedure using TRUS simulation. 

## Current objectives
- Virtual TRUS
- Annotation of prostate zonal anatomy (growth zones) 
- Volume estimation
- US deformation

Also consider
- Simulation of core placement
- Scoring metric (based on zone coverage during use)
