Helping to create sustainable medical programs for African healthcare centres. There is a current need in Senegal for training and clinical applications of ultrasound guided interventions, specifically prostate cancer imaging tools. This program will be designed to train medical workers in the prostate biopsy procedure using TRUS simulation. 

## Current objectives
- TRUS simulation
- Annotation of zonal anatomy (growth zones) 
- Volume estimation
- US deformation
- Check if user covers every zone
