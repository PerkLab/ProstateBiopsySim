# ProstateBiopsySim
TRUS and prostate biopsy training simulator

## Background
Helping to create sustainable medical programs for healthcare centres in African countries. There is a current need in Senegal for training and clinical applications of ultrasound (US) guided interventions, specifically prostate cancer imaging tools. This program will be designed to train medical workers in the prostate biopsy procedure using TRUS simulation. 

## Current objectives
### 1) Create training data set
  - US volume with gland and urethra segmentation
  - MRI volume with zonal segmentation
  - Register US and MRI together
### 2) Reslice US while moving an EM tracked mock probe
### 3) Simulate biopsy needle
  - Should be aimable
  - Module for needle trajectory placement
### 4) Find prostate imaging and biopsy protocols and implement scoring metric
