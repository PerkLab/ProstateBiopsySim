# ProstateBiopsySim
TRUS and prostate biopsy training simulator

## Background
We are helping to create sustainable medical programs for African healthcare centres. There is a current need for training and clinical applications of ultrasound guided interventions, specifically prostate cancer imaging tools. This program will be designed to train medical workers in the prostate biopsy procedure using TRUS simulation. 

## Current objectives
- Annotation of zonal anatomy (growth zones) 
- Volume estimation
- US deformation
